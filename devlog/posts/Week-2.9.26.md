Starting a dev log.
Within this log I'll be posting some of my thoughts and experiences throughout the week.
We'll see how long I can keep this going.


Last week we read 'A Few useful things to know about machine learning' by Pedro Domingos.
It was an interesting, albeit long read. I learned some simple ways LLMs are trained.
But the high level parts were too high level for me.


This week we read Overton: A data system for Monitoring and Improving Machine-Learned Products, by
Christopher Re, Feng Niu, Pallavi Gudipati and Charles Srisuwannanukorn.

This one made a bit more sense, but only barely. It contained some examples that were helpful though.

Started Vibe Coding with Cursor this week.
Cursor is quite the powerful tool. At some point I'll put into writing how I feel about
the advent of powerful LLMs. I'm trying to divorce the name AI from the concept because
indeed this is not Artificial Intelligence, that much is clear. But I don't know
how much that matters right now.

That being said, it is pretty fun.
I first had it create a a Project Management tool for me.
I called it DORA, based on King Gidora from the Godzilla movies.
This is because JIRA is based on Godzilla (Gojira).

Then I had it create a gamified to do list.
I followed that up with this blog website.

The idea behind this devLog is that I can easily update it and have it 
connected to my portfolio, without having to make direct changes
to it or host the posts somewhere.

The way it works is:
1. Create a post md
2. Make sure its in the posts folder
3. Add it to the posts.json
4. Push the changes to github
5. Git actions pushes changes to my portfolio
6. Give it a few minutes
7. ????
8. Profit!

So far so good, all the projects are up and hosted on github.

I did run into some issues this week, such as breaking my Operating System, oops.
Resetting my setup and workflow was annoying but, you learn lessons from such mistakes.

On to next week.
