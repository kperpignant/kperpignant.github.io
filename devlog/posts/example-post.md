# Example Post

This is an example post to demonstrate how the blog works.

## How to add posts

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `posts/` folder.
2. Add an entry to `posts.json` with `title`, `date`, and `file` (the slug).
3. That's it—no build step required.

## Markdown works

You can use **bold**, *italic*, lists, code blocks, and more:

```js
const greeting = "Hello, static blog!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Happy writing!
